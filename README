LICENSE file for more information.

---------------------
 Build Prerequisites
---------------------

To build Titanium from source, you will need the following prerequisites:

  - Python (see platform specific notes below)
  - Scons package - <http://www.scons.org/>
  - Platform compiler (see below for each platform)

Python and SCons are used to build Titanium but not required for end-development
or runtime.

To build Titanium, you will need to first checkout the Titanium source code
from <http://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_desktop/tree/master>. 

Currently, we are building Titanium for 32-bit architectures but intend to support 64-bit
very soon. If you have patches or would like to assist, please contact us (see below for
IRC or email information).

-------
 Setup
-------

You will first need to update the kroll submodule that is checked in to Titanium before
you can successfully build.  You can run the following command from the root source 
directory to update the submodule:

> git submodule update --init

This will pull the contents of the submodule into your local kroll folder.

----------
 Building
----------

Titanium uses SCons for building.  You can run scons by typing:

> scons

To enable a debug build, use the debug flag:

> scons debug=1

To build the packaged bundles, use package flag:

> scons package=1

The output of the build will be in a folder named build\<osname> such as 
build/osx for OSX.

-----------
 Testing
-----------

Titanium uses the Drillbit application under apps/ to perform tests. You can build 
and run Drillbit:

> scons drillbit run=1

---------------
 Platform Info 
---------------

Titanium requires platform-specific builds.  Currently, Titanium builds on Win32, Linux 
and Mac OSX 10.5.4+.

Win32
------

You will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 + Service Packs to build Titanium. We have
not tested building Titanium on Visual Studio 2008.  You will need to obtain the 
Microsoft Visual Studio Service Pack 1 to compile Titanium.

Needed service packs from Microsoft:

- VS 2005 Team Suite SP1 <http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=BB4A75AB-E2D4-4C96-B39D-37BAF6B5B1DC&displaylang=en>
- MS Visual Studio 2005 SP1
- Windows Server 2003 SDK R2 <http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0baf2b35-c656-4969-ace8-e4c0c0716adb&displaylang=en>

Win32 Python Notes
==================

You will need to set the environment variable PYTHONHOME to the location of your 
installed python.

Set PYTHONHOME environment (Windows only):

> set PYTHONHOME=c:\Python25

(Suggest you open Control Panel and set it in your permanent environment)
You will need to have Python 2.5 installed to build Win32. Later versions currently
are not supported. You can download Python at <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5.2>


Win32 Ruby Notes
================

To build Ruby module support you will need to first install Ruby 1.8+ and make sure
it's own your path.  There is a problem with the included Ruby header file named
config.h (under $RUBY\lib\ruby\1.8\i386-mswin32\) that requires you to hand edit
the file to comment out the check.  If you receive the following warning:

fatal error C1189: #error : MSC version unmatch

Then you have experienced this error.  Hand edit the file and comment out the top
of the header file that checks the version and re-compile.

 
OSX
----

You will need XCode 3.0+ to build Titanium and it must be built on Leopard. Titanium
is only supported on Leopard (or later).

If you have xcode installed, you should be able to build Titanium with no additional
dependencies.

Linux
------

Each distribution varies slightly for building Titanium on a Linux distribution.

Ubuntu 8.10 32bit
=================

1. Install the required libraries:

sudo apt-get install build-essential ruby rubygems libzip-ruby scons libxml2-dev libgtk2.0-dev python-dev ruby-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libnotify-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev libxss-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libnotify-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev python2.5-dev libxss-dev


2. Install Git:

sudo apt-get install git-core


You may need a later version of Scons for Linux if you get build errors.  (>=1.2.0)
