namespace: Titanium.Filesystem.File.readLine
type: method
description: |
    Return one line from the file specified by this Filesystem.File object.
    This method will return null when it finishes reading the file or if
    it encounters and error. The file object will remain in an open state until
    the entire file has been read via Filestream.File.readLine. It is recommended
    that new applications use Filesystem.Filestream to read files instead, which
    allow for explicit control over the native file handles.
since: 0.2.0
platforms: [osx, linux, win32]
